# Video Frame Extraction using Python and OpenCV

## Introduction
This program extracts frames from a video file and saves them as images. The program is written in Python and uses OpenCV to extract the frames. The frames are extracted in the same directory as the video file in a folder named `extracted_frames`.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6.5
* OpenCV 3.4.1

## Usage
To run the program, simply run the following command in the terminal:
```
python frame_extraction.py <video_path>
```
where `<video_path>` is the path to the video file.
